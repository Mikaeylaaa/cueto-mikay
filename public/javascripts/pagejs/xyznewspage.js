You tell your sales assistant what you are looking for and he leads you straight to the correct shelf. You ask for price comparisons and the information is immediately conveyed to you. When you finally decide on what to buy, instead of standing in a long queue, you can make payment with your sales assistant who also knows whether you have a membership with the retailer.All that may seem too good to be true, but it is now possible with a new robot that was launched by Newstead Technologies on Friday (May 26)."
